## Douban thai tv series scraper

I wrote this in hope of bringing joy to my mom who's been a huge fan of thai tv series using my broken coding ability... if there's any question feel free to note them in ISSUES, although I believe that this s\\t couldn't have been simpler.

You do need to **replace 'header'** so that you'd not be recognized by the target website as a web scraper in which case your requests get blocked. Otherwise you'll be lucky enough to receive Douban's coders' teasing by sending you '418' which means they "refuse to make coffee in a teapot".

## IMDB biography movie scraper
March 21, 2020.

My mom was happy yeasterday, so the project was ok. Today it came to me that I've been working on academic stuff for so long that I could exhaust my interests and passions. Hence, I decided that it was time to relax and be a 肥宅(loser), so there I was, trying to get advice on biography movies on this Douban website, just to prove Douban's coders could be so harsh when you try to have some fun--something about json went wrong and i couldn't get proper origin codes by sending requests to the url. Therefore, I turned to IMDB in hope that maybe I could find some luck there. The fact that I'm writing this to you indicates that I am a LUCKY STAR--IMDB opened its arms and made "IMDB biography.py" happen. Thank you! I feel energetic again.
